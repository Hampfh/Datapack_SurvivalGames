### What is this?  
<p>
This Minecraft datapack lets you instantly create a hunger games/survival games set up in your world. The datapack spreads players over an area and introduces a shrinking border which over a time of max 30 minutes will unit all the players in the middle. The pack comes equipped with multiple options to enable customizability, such as: toggle coordinates, toggle UHC mode, toggle teams, etc... 

Furthermore, this pack also has support for map re-generation by moving the whole playing area, thus enabling for different maps every match if requested.

### Installation
Simply install the datapack by dragging it into the "datapacks" folder in your world and get going in unzipped form. After installing the pack it is instantiated by running the command `/function sg:triggers/init` which will set up everything and prepare the game. Only moderators can start and change settings in-game, to become a moderator simply give yourself the tag `Moderator` by running the command `/tag @p add Moderator`

You're good to go, good luck in the games
